Now everyone wants it and local rather means smaller breweries around the city, that are specific to Utrecht.</p>\n<p>&quot;A &#39;hoppy&#39; IPA is basically a blond beer, that is more ‘hop forward’. The two main characteristics that hop has are the bittering components, so the more hop you put in, the bitter taste you get (especially the earlier you put it in during the production process). The other trait comes from the type of the hop as there a huge variety of different hops, from all part of the world, with all their specific aroma. The later you add the hop the more you get from these aromas. There is a very wide spectrum of these aromas ranging from fruitiness to grassy/herbal/ spiciness.</p>\n<p>&quot;The IPA’ (Indian Pale Ale) is definitely the big hit of the last 3 years.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/o2WSldX.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"fruity-beer\">Fruity beer</h3>\n<p>&quot;The process is completely different, in a sense that these beers are made with a process called ‘wild fermentation’ in the start. So in the beginning they create a more sour beer, that really uses only hops as conservation and it uses natural yeast, so it needs quite a lot of time to mature. If you leave it this way than its is a ‘Lambic beer’, but if you start to mature it on for instance sour cherries, then it will turn into a cherry beer or ‘Kriek’ as they call it in Belgium.</p>\n<p>&quot;So if you would like to taste a real sour cherry beer, ask for an ‘Oud Kriek’ (old Kriek). Our Krieks are matured on real cherries, that people normally eat, but some breweries add syrup or just fruit juice, which there is a very heated debate about in the industry.</p>\n"}},"klijs-boon":{"index":{"title":"Contemporary fashion","date":"2015-11-28","lat":52.094907,"lng":5.120084,"author":"Gwen Boon","header":"http://i.imgur.com/0I4gBUe.jpg","shop":"Klijs & Boon","avatar":"http://i.imgur.com/LFAfprN.jpg","tags":"fashion","body":"<h3 id=\"-for-me-sexy-might-mean-having-baggy-top-and-shorter-bottoms-\">&quot;For me sexy might mean having baggy top and shorter bottoms&quot;</h3>\n<p>Gwen owns Klijs &amp; Boon, but before that she studied at the Utrecht Art Academy and worked as a designer in Antwerp.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gwen-says-women-should-be-feminine-but-also-a-little-tough\">Gwen says women should be feminine but also a little tough</h3>\n<p>&quot;We want women to be feminine but a little bit tough, sexy and more confident.

If there’s an animation currently in progress, we stop it first, and then proceed smoothly from whatever intermediate state it left us in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a small example that was given in the introduction from Fabric.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">render: function () {\n  var animationProps;\n  if (this.state.hovering) {\n    animationProps = {\n      duration: 200,\n      animation: {\n        rotateX: 160\n      }\n    };\n  } else {\n    animationProps = {\n      duration: 1100, // longer due to swinging\n      animation: {\n        rotateX: [0, &#39;spring&#39;]\n      }\n    };\n  }\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div onMouseEnter={function () { this.setState({hovering: true}); }}\n         onMouseLeave={function () { this.setState({hovering: false}); }}&gt;\n      &lt;VelocityComponent {...animationProps}&gt;\n        {this.renderTopState()}\n      &lt;/VelocityComponent&gt;\n      {this.renderUnderneathStats()}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will result in:\n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54ac6f9ae4b0cf1d82a4b59e/t/560a9a19e4b08fcd39795d27/1443535397904/release_summary.gif?format=300w\" tyle=\"max-width: 320px; width: 100%; position:static;\"></p>\n<p>As the name implies <code>&lt;VelocityTransitionGroup /&gt;</code> can be used to animate a group of element at the same time. In the example on the Fabric blog we can use it being used to animate an input slider, but that&#39;s not all. When you pay close attention you will the the toggle switch animating and a &quot;jawbone&quot; collapse. Al these animation are done at once.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54ac6f9ae4b0cf1d82a4b59e/t/560a9a69e4b0a427e3b70022/1443535503361/?format=750w\" tyle=\"max-width: 320px; width: 100%; position:static;\"></p>\n<p>I was very impressed with the work and I&#39;m trying to push this as the new standard for animating React components at the company where I work. And will be the default for all my pet projects.</p>\n"}},"vorpal":{"index":{"title":"Vorpal.js","date":"2015-10-19","lat":52.117114,"lng":53.117114,"author":"Ramon Gebben","header":"http://i.imgur.com/Ex08W0g.jpg","shop":"Daily Javascript","avatar":"http://i.imgur.com/UBLi3O3.jpg","template":"article.jade","tags":"drink","body":"<p>Vorpal (GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/dthree/vorpal\">dthree/vorpal</a>, License: MIT, npm: vorpal)</p>\n<p>Vorpal is a framework for building interactive CLI applications.

Because it works together with some other tools, you can also call it a “framework”. Now, if you’ve never heard of or used Vue before, you are probably thinking: great, yet another JavaScript framework! I get it. That was my first thought as well, that is why I never looked at it with a serious eye. Vue isn’t particularly new, it has being in the making for almost two years now, and the first public release was in February 2014. Over time it has evolving into a great engine to build beautiful production ready app with.</p>\n<p>What makes it so awesome? Well, it supports all the features we are used to from libraries such as React, Ember and Angular but it&#39;s size and api are a lot simpler.\nA thing I love in libraries, simplicity.</p>\n<p>So let&#39;s take a look at a few small examples and let&#39;s start with data binding.</p>\n<p>This is how we define the <code>template</code> which we are gonna use:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-html\">&lt;div id=&quot;binding&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;{{message}}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;input v-model=&quot;message&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here we give it some data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">\nlet binding = new Vue({\n  el: &#39;#binding&#39;,\n  data: {\n    message: &#39;Daily Javascript&#39;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would give is a <code>div</code> with an <code>input</code> field and a preview of the value it holds. When you start typing, Vue will take over from there.\nThat&#39;s cool right? Ok I get it data binding does not impress you anymore. Do you like working with components?\nVue takes an approach that is very similar to React: it’s components all the way down.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const Example = Vue.extend({\n    template: &#39;&lt;div&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/div&gt;&#39;,\n    data () {\n        return {\n            message: &#39;Daily Javascript!&#39;\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n// register it with the tag &lt;example&gt;\nVue.component(&#39;example&#39;, Example);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can use it like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-html\">&lt;example&gt;&lt;/example&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because modularity is key nowadays it comes with the opportunity to <code>scope</code> styles to a component.\nThat would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-html\">&lt;style scoped &gt;\n.message {\n  color: red;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is a full example component of how it would look when you would have it setup with a combination of <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack/webpack\">Webpack</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader\">vue-loader</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.evanyou.me/images/vue-hot.gif\" alt=\"demo\"></p>\n<p>It comes with a lot of more features that I will not go into such as routing and a build-in transition system.</p>\n<p>There is a demo for the transition system which demonstrates state-based tweening with Vue:</p>\n<p><p data-height=\"268\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"XmZNOG\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"yyx990803\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/yyx990803/pen/XmZNOG/'>Vue.js elastic header component</a> by Evan You (<a href='http://codepen.io/yyx990803'>@yyx990803</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p></p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n"}}}
