### "People can have their favourite art in their suits, no matter what the style"

GMraven make special tailored suits; printing the work of local artists on the inside. They have only just opened shop and are always looking for more artists to work with.

### GMraven promotes local talent

"its the mission of GMraven to host four galleries a year. So we had a gallery down the road during the opening where we hosted around 100 people who got see the beautiful artwork on the wall with the same art printed within the suits.

â€œAt first it was very hard to find artists but now they see what I do and want to get involved. So its a mutually beneficial arrangement where they provide amazing art work to us while we provide a great platform for their work that they can show their friends!

### Guus recommends pop art

"My family loves art so there was always a lot of influence from when I was growing up. I appreciate so many kinds of art, but I really like bright and vibrant pop art especially. There are lots of options here so people can have their favourite art inside their suits no matter what the style.
