### "Why not try a cold brew coffee?"

Skip began his tinkering with coffee in Berlin with Bonanza Coffee Heroes, and has since set up base in a basement on the Shoutenstraat. He offers experimental blends and plenty of advice for coffee drinkers.

### Skip warns of Starbucks

"Starbucks use good beans but roast too much, it removes flavour. There could have been fruity and acidic tones, but instead it turns burnt and ashy. I once had a machine from Starbucks, but when I opened it, the grinder was covered in a greasy peanut butter substance. The beans were not dry enough so there was too much oil, and with oxygen it gives a metallic flavour.

### Skip recommends a cold brew

"Why not try a cold brew coffee? The tones are far less acidic we noticed when you let it sit for for about 12 hours at around 7 degrees you have a beautiful coffee that is thick and vicious.

"Just use the sieve and put it through the aero-press, filtering once or twice and the result is a really nice clean, thick coffee. Something very easy to drink in the summer but just watch out for the shakes because it can be a little too easy to drink!

### "I told him if he really likes that previous pair we would repair it for him"

There was originally a fire department where Daen's is now; it still says 'Brandweer' on the outside of our building.

It was originally a clothes store, but it is now a food and wine bar the way you have them in Paris: where people can stop by after a long day’s work or shopping and then go off again.

“We now also have a place for home-made breakfast, lunch and snacks without anything artificial.

### Willem recommends hardy fashion and Margret's Wines

“We have a mix of fashion brands from France, Italy and Scandinavia. I really like to see people come into the shop wearing something we used to sell 6 years ago. I think sustainable and hardy fashion is very important; sometimes it’s worth paying extra for something which will stay with you.

"A guy came into the shop recently looking for a new pair of jeans because his last pair was worn out at the groin from his bike; I told him if he really likes that previous pair we would repair it for him.

"We like to make sure our clothes are timeless but also still fashionable to help people over that threshold, otherwise people will always be wearing the same thing. When you buy on the internet you don’t get the impression you need of the quality and you find people always buy similar things, we try to add something new but without its going out of fashion tomorrow.

"We get our wine from a great little wine shop around the corner called Margaret Wines; they are really good quality wines and are very specialist which helps us stay off the beaten track.
