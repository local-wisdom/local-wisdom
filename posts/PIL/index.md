### "My favourite is a combination of greenmachine-washed lamp-leather and simple blouse"

Public Image Labels, lead by Ilse, is stocked with brands from Paris and Berlin.

### Brick and mortar vs. Online

"We always try to offer a very personal feeling when people visit the shop. Usually they leave with something totally unexpected in a good way, and that’s something they don’t tend to do with online shopping.

"We also try to help people quickly so they can be in and out if they need more convenience. I really like that you can make your own atmosphere in the shop as well, and here we are very refined.

### Ilse recommends Lamp-leather and safari jackets

"My favourite item at the moment is the combination of these green machine-washed lamp-leather and a simple blouse on the top, its very elegant. But for the men, this season the safari jackets are well in fashion.
