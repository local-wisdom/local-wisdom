### "A simple Cabbage - roasted in the after being covered in beurre noisette"

Lamber is the head chef of Florent at Visscherplein 75. While inspired by the abundance of world-class gastronomy in Paris, he would 'Noma' in Copenhagen reaches the top of his own restaurant wishlist.


### Lamber recommends a simple cabbage dish

"I think it’s important though for people to eat more vegetables, so as the head of the team it is great fun to think about new ways to prepare them. We really enjoy leaving our guests an experience with that ‘wow’ effect through a healthy balanced meal.

"A simple cabbage – roasted in the oven after being covered in a beurre noisette.  It really gives the dish a nutty flavour and lets you experience the simplicity of something like cabbage in a whole new way. The cabbage dish I mentioned above is a Florent favourite as an evergreen side.

The dish is really quite simple, coarse even and a very basic vegetable at its heart.  For me, it’s important to not have so many miscellaneous and potentially contradictory flavours with our dishes.  Think about your own palate and what would tempt your tastebuds clearly and simply.

### Seasonal ingredients are crucial

“We prepare our dishes using seasonally available products, trying to use as much as we can from within Europe.  Depending on the season, the weather and market availability it can affect our French-Belgian offering, so we need to strike the right balance so our guests can experience the simplicity of the dishes, still keeping the intensity of flavours.
