### "A hoppy IPA for the colder months, a fruit beer for the warmer"

"Six years ago, it was mainly tourists who asked for “something Dutch” you know. Now everyone wants it and local rather means smaller breweries around the city, that are specific to Utrecht.

"A 'hoppy' IPA is basically a blond beer, that is more ‘hop forward’. The two main characteristics that hop has are the bittering components, so the more hop you put in, the bitter taste you get (especially the earlier you put it in during the production process). The other trait comes from the type of the hop as there a huge variety of different hops, from all part of the world, with all their specific aroma. The later you add the hop the more you get from these aromas. There is a very wide spectrum of these aromas ranging from fruitiness to grassy/herbal/ spiciness.

"The IPA’ (Indian Pale Ale) is definitely the big hit of the last 3 years.

### Fruity beer

"The process is completely different, in a sense that these beers are made with a process called ‘wild fermentation’ in the start. So in the beginning they create a more sour beer, that really uses only hops as conservation and it uses natural yeast, so it needs quite a lot of time to mature. If you leave it this way than its is a ‘Lambic beer’, but if you start to mature it on for instance sour cherries, then it will turn into a cherry beer or ‘Kriek’ as they call it in Belgium.

"So if you would like to taste a real sour cherry beer, ask for an ‘Oud Kriek’ (old Kriek). Our Krieks are matured on real cherries, that people normally eat, but some breweries add syrup or just fruit juice, which there is a very heated debate about in the industry.
