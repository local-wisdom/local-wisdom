### "I told him if he really likes that previous pair we would repair it for him"

There was originally a fire department where Daen's is now; it still says 'Brandweer' on the outside of our building.

It was originally a clothes store, but it is now a food and wine bar the way you have them in Paris: where people can stop by after a long day’s work or shopping and then go off again.

“We now also have a place for home-made breakfast, lunch and snacks without anything artificial.

### Willem recommends hardy fashion and Margret's Wines

“We have a mix of fashion brands from France, Italy and Scandinavia. I really like to see people come into the shop wearing something we used to sell 6 years ago. I think sustainable and hardy fashion is very important; sometimes it’s worth paying extra for something which will stay with you.

"A guy came into the shop recently looking for a new pair of jeans because his last pair was worn out at the groin from his bike; I told him if he really likes that previous pair we would repair it for him.

"We like to make sure our clothes are timeless but also still fashionable to help people over that threshold, otherwise people will always be wearing the same thing. When you buy on the internet you don’t get the impression you need of the quality and you find people always buy similar things, we try to add something new but without its going out of fashion tomorrow.

"We get our wine from a great little wine shop around the corner called Margaret Wines; they are really good quality wines and are very specialist which helps us stay off the beaten track.
