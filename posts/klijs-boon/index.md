### "For me sexy might mean having baggy top and shorter bottoms"

Gwen owns Klijs & Boon, but before that she studied at the Utrecht Art Academy and worked as a designer in Antwerp.

### Gwen says women should be feminine but also a little tough

"We want women to be feminine but a little bit tough, sexy and more confident. For me sexy might mean having baggy top and shorter bottoms, maybe a top that’s a little see-through if you have a nice bra underneath. I like a good mixture that’s also classy.

"We try to get to know our brands, we did a really personal interview with one of our biggest brands brands libertine libertine about their production and why they do it. I wanted to have fashion labels that have been out there for a while and have good production because you know the quality will be better. We try to balance the commercial items by always offering something new as well.

"We don't try to push our own tastes on visitors all the time but I like to suggest things when i'm enthusiastic about a piece, which tend to be the things in the window.

### Gwen doesn't always fit the mold

"in Holland there is still a lot of pretending, and then in Copenhagen, where I always go, its so nice, I know people really well, its a lot of fun and I don't need to wear heels to be fashionable.

"I remember once going to a fashion show in Amsterdam and I was wearing a really cool suit with all sorts of colours and sneakers, but all the other girls were wearing the same typical Amsterdam dresses so it was really awkward when we were photographed together!
