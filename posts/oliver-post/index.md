### What is your favorite dish to eat and/or cook? What tips do you have when you are cooking it?

I know people tend to have one, but I don’t really have a true favorite dish. For me, eating is something that must be done with passion no matter what dish you have. I do think it’s important though for people to eat more vegetables, so as the head of the team it is great fun to think about new ways to prepare them. We really enjoy leaving our guests an experience with that ‘wow’ effect through a healthy balanced meal.

### What is your favorite dish at florent and why? What would you recommend and why?

On the subject of vegetables, an example of this is a simple cabbage – roasted in the oven after being covered in a beurre noisette.  It really gives the dish a nutty flavour and lets you experience the simplicity of something like cabbage in a whole new way. The cabbage dish I mentioned above is a Florent favourite as an evergreen side dish. This is a great example of the concept of the restaurant.  The dish is really quite simple, coarse even and a very basic vegetable at its heart.  For me, it’s important to not have so many miscellaneous and potentially contradictory flavours with our dishes.  Think about your own palate and what would tempt your tastebuds clearly and simply.

### What kind of ingredients do you work with?

“We prepare our dishes using seasonally available products, trying to use as much as we can from within Europe.  Depending on the season, the weather and market availability it can affect our French-Belgian offering, so we need to strike the right balance so our guests can experience the simplicity of the dishes, still keeping the intensity of flavours.
Do you have a favorite restaurant anywhere in the world?
Paris is one of my all-time favourite cities.  I love that in a little more than three hours by train, you can experience amazing produce, incredible food markets and some of the most famous restaurants in the world.  I love to experience the gastronomy and service.  Having said that, Noma in Copenhagen is very high on my wishlist to one day experience
