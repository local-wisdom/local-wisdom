### "Audio-technica and soon the Thorens turntables are good, affordable players "

Jeroen has loved records since he was 16 and can't imagine being in a place without being surrounded by them.

### Vinyl

"Vinyl is the thing I grew up with. The funny thing is, when I first started at Plato there was just a tiny section of the last vinyl albums they had left in the shop. Now it’s coming back again and its 40% of our business.

“It’s something more lasting than cds, I think a lot of young people that buy vinyl are fed up of skipping and shuffling through tracks, so it’s a very relaxing way to listen to music.

"After twenty minutes you have a feel of the flow of the album, there’s a story in there which makes it worthwhile. There’s one big pressing plant in Holland that bands go to, but usually they come to us to promote cds.

"We find second hand Vinyl’s anywhere we can, but there are a lot of really bad albums from the 70s and 80s so we refuse to sell music we don’t like, they have to have some meaning to us. You will never find Lionel Richie in our second hand albums.

### Jeroen recommends Audio-technica and soon the Thorens turntables

"We have the Audio-technica and soon the Thorens turntables which are good, affordable players that we have high expectations of. We also have a couple of people in town that repair any equipment because it is important that people have a good audio system that enhances your listening experience.
