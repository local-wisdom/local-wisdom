### "Why not try a cold brew coffee?"

Skip began his tinkering with coffee in Berlin with Bonanza Coffee Heroes, and has since set up base in a basement on the Shoutenstraat. He offers experimental blends and plenty of advice for coffee drinkers.

### Skip warns of Starbucks

"Starbucks use good beans but roast too much, it removes flavour. There could have been fruity and acidic tones, but instead it turns burnt and ashy. I once had a machine from Starbucks, but when I opened it, the grinder was covered in a greasy peanut butter substance. The beans were not dry enough so there was too much oil, and with oxygen it gives a metallic flavour.

### Skip recommends a cold brew

"Why not try a cold brew coffee? The tones are far less acidic we noticed when you let it sit for for about 12 hours at around 7 degrees you have a beautiful coffee that is thick and vicious.

"Just use the sieve and put it through the aero-press, filtering once or twice and the result is a really nice clean, thick coffee. Something very easy to drink in the summer but just watch out for the shakes because it can be a little too easy to drink!
