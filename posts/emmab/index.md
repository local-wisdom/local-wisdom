### "A stylish lamp always makes your place much cozier"

Birgit studied in Architecture and Visual Art at the Utrecht Art academy and has now been at Emma b. on the Oudergracht for about seven years.

### On product style

“Since we are an Interior shop, we sell a wide range of products but here the concentration is on timeless Scandinavian inspired design. Sometimes we have few products from other designers and places, but mostly they are all coming from the North.
“The style is contemporary, yet very “warm”. Some designs might be simple with cold colours, but either in the material or design, one can always feel the certain warmth in the item.


### Birgit’s recommendation

“Well, initially I thought about choosing a stylish lamp since it always make your place much cozier, but I have decided for this little grey table.

"It might look like an average side-table; however the name will persuade you otherwise. It is called DLM, which stands for ‘Don’t Leave Me’. The name was chosen due to the option of simply grabbing the upper handler and taking it with you. Especially in a Utrecht’s smaller apartments this might come very handy since you can just pick it up on place it wherever you want!
